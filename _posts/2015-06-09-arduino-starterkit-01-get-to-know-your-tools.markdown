I bought the [Arduino Starter Kit](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoStarterKit) and started working through the projects. The first project - Get to Know Your Tools - is about connecting a resistor and an LED in the circuit. The LED is being fed current by pushing one or two push buttons (switches); when forming a pair, the two switches can be connected in parallel or in series.

`One push button switched off`

`Two push buttons in parallel switched off`

`Two push buttons in parallel switched on` If either switch is pressed the LED will light on

`Two push buttons in series switched off`

`Two push buttons in series switched on` Both switches must be pressed for the LED to light on
