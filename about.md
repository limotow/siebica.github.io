My name is Sebastian-Ion TINCU. I am a senior IT consultant with a focus on web applications. During my career, even since 2005, I have applied [Agile principles](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) and practices. 

Certified in Java, I am interested in dynamic programming languages and programming languages built on the Javascript. I like to program on the JVM, in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) or [AngularJS](https://angular.io/). 

I follow blogs of world leading consultants like [Martin Fowler's Bliki](http://martinfowler.com/bliki). I also read from IT publishers like [Manning](http://manning.com/) or [Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/).

In my spare time, I like playing around with [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and reading science-fiction books.
