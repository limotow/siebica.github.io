I bought the [Arduino Starter Kit](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoStarterKit) and started working through the projects. The first project - Get to Know Your Tools - is about connecting a resistor and an LED in the circuit. The LED is being fed current by pushing one or two push buttons (switches); when forming a pair, the two switches can be connected in parallel or in series.
